OpenAQ is the world's largest free and open source platform for air quality data. To gather and harmonize the world's air quality data OpenAQ searches and scrapes hundreds of data sources to extract and store data. Unlike some other air quality data repositories, OpenAQ only gathers physical measurements and does not collected aggregated values such as AQI (Air Quality Index) values.


## API

The best way to access data on the OpenAQ platform is through the OpenAQ REST API. The API allows programmatic and queryable access to the OpenAQ database.
