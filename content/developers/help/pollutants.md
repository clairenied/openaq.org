The OpenAQ database currently ingests the following pollutant data, with a focus on:

* PM1 - particulate matter 1 microns (μm)
* PM2.5 - particulate matter 2.5 microns (μm)
* PM4 - particulate matter 4 microns (μm)
* PM10 - particulate matter 10 microns (μm)
* BC - black carbon particulates, part of PM2.5
* O₃ - Ozone gas
* CO - Carbon monoxide gas
* NO₂ - Nitrogen dioxide gas
* NO - Nirogen monoxide gas
* NOx - Nitrogen oxides
* SO₂ - Sulfur dioxide gas
* CH₄ - Methane gas
* CO₂ - Carbon dioxide gas

## Units of measurement
Measurements of pollutants are reported in a variety of units depending on how the data is reported from the original data provider. Units are not normalized in the OpenAQ system with the exception of converting ppm (part-per million) to ppb (parts-per billion). Volume units are not converted to mass units, nor vice versa, they are served as originally reported.

### Particulate Matter (PM)
Many terms are frequently associated with suspended matter in the air (i.e., airborne particles)—particulate matter (PM) is one of these terms. The subscript for “PM,” for example, “PM2.5” or “PM10” refers to a specific size fraction, which are described based on “aerodynamic diameter,”—the diameter of the particle in question under the assumption that the particle is a sphere, as equivalent to the diameter of a hypothetical spherical particle with a density of 1 g cm−3, assuming that both particles have equal terminal velocity. 
For example, PM10 is particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 μm and below, and PM2.5 with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm and below.
PM is a mixture of solid and liquid particles suspended in air; when breathed in, they can get deep into the lungs and, for even smaller particles, can get into the bloodstream. Depending on its composition, they can cause serious health problems such as respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses. 
Black Carbon (BC)
Also known as soot. It is formed from the incomplete combustion of fuel burning. Inhaling black carbon can cause cardiovascular and respiratory problems, cancer and birth defects. It also contributes to global warming because of its capability to absorb radiation from the sun.
Not to be confused with carbon black, a manufactured material. 
Ozone 
Molecular formula: O3. While there are emission sources that directly emit ozone gas, such as photocopiers, the main source of ground-level ozone is its formation in the troposphere from the reaction of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with sunlight. Ozone is one of the main components of photochemical smog that contributes to haze above cities. Ozone causes respiratory irritation and aggravation of existing respiratory conditions to humans, as well as damage to vegetation.


### Carbon Monoxide
Molecular formula: CO. Alongside black carbon or soot, carbon monoxide gas is formed from incomplete combustion of fuel burning. It is colorless, odorless, and tasteless; symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include dizziness, headaches, vomiting, and confusion; at higher concentrations, carbon monoxide can cause unconsciousness or death. 


### Nitrogen Dioxide
Molecular formula: NO2. It is formed from burning of fuel. NO2 also contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone and particulate matter. On its own, NO2 can cause respiratory irritation; longer exposures can cause more serious respiratory diseases, asthma, and respiratory infections.


### Nitrogen Monoxide
Molecular formula: NO. Also referred to as nitrogen monoxide or nitric oxide. It is a colorless gas that contributes to the formation of photochemical smog.


### Nitrogen Oxides
NOx refers to the total of NO and NO2. These can contribute to problems with heart and lungs and have links to decreased resistance to infection. NOx is also a major contributor to photochemical smog, which causes unsightly haze, serious human health effects, and damage to vegetation. Once it dissolves in water, It can also contribute to the formation of acid rain.


### Sulfur Dioxide
Molecular formula: SO2. Sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere is formed from fossil fuel burning as well as smelting of mineral ores that contain sulfur. It can also lead to the formation of particulate matter (PM) and acid rain, which is debilitating to the forests, crops, bodies of water and building structures. Human exposure to sulfur dioxide can lead to acute respiratory irritation, as well as changes in lung function or cardiovascular diseases.


### Methane
Molecular formula: CH4. Methane is a primary component of natural gas; emission sources in the atmosphere include agriculture, wetlands, wastewater treatment, and landfills. Methane is greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. 


### Carbon Dioxide
Molecular formula: CO2. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. It is formed from the respiration of animals and humans, combustion of fuels and fermentation. Plants use carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. Anthropogenic uses include refrigerant (“dry ice”), a component in fire extinguishers, beverage carbonation, and inflation of miscellaneous materials.
