OpenAQ gathers measurements across a range of pollutants. Some of the pollutants currently in the OpenAQ database include:

* PM1 - particulate matter 1 microns (μm)
* PM2.5 - particulate matter 2.5 microns (μm)
* PM4 - particulate matter 4 microns (μm)
* PM10 - particulate matter 10 microns (μm)
* BC - black carbon particulates, part of PM2.5
* O₃ - Ozone gas
* CO - Carbon monoxide gas
* NO₂ - Nitrogen dioxide gas
* NO - Nirogen monoxide gas
* NOx - Nitrogen oxides
* SO₂ - Sulfur dioxide gas
* CH₄ - Methane gas
* CO₂ - Carbon dioxide gas


## Units of measurement
Measurements of pollutants are reported in a variety of units depending on how the data is reported from the original data provider. Units are not normalized in the OpenAQ system with the exception of converting ppm (part-per million) to ppb (parts-per billion). Volume units are not converted to mass units, nor vice versa, they are served as originally reported.
