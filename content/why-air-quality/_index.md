Air pollution is the fourth leading risk factor for early death and the leading environmental cause of death worldwide, contributing to 1 out of 8 global deaths and over 7 million deaths annually worldwide as estimated by the World Health Organization. Up to 99% of us are breathing polluted air, cutting lives short by an average of 2.2 years worldwide. 

Air pollution impacts our health in many ways, even starting when we're in the womb. The burden is unequal, with some people being far more vulnerable and some breathing far more polluted air. For example, children are particularly susceptible to air pollution’s insidious effects—they breathe more rapidly than adults, taking in more polluted air and are proportionally exposed at higher levels due to their small bodies and developing organs. In a 2018 report, Air Pollution and Child Health, WHO estimated outdoor and indoor air pollution resulted in 543,000 deaths in children under the age of 5 years in 2016.

Another example are marginalized communities across the globe that face worse outcomes in many areas of life, including poorer health driven by disproportionate exposure to air pollution, due to colonialism and racism.

## Air Quality Data

Despite the urgency of confronting this global challenge, only 61% of governments worldwide produce air quality data, leaving over 1 billion citizens without access to fundamental information that could protect them from the harmful effects of air pollution.

Reliable data on air pollution are fundamental to understanding and taking corrective action to improve air quality. Air quality data underpin all actions on air pollution. They tell us how much pollution is in the air we breathe. They predict how air pollution will change in space and time. They shape our understanding of how air pollution impacts human health, climate change, ecological health and economic well-being.

Air quality data serve as an important foundation for the design, implementation, enforcement and assessment of the effectiveness of pollution control policies. Access to air quality data is critical for public, private and civil society initiatives to improve the air we breathe. Accurate, timely and sustained monitoring provides the evidence needed to develop targeted solutions to air pollution.
