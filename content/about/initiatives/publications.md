OpenAQ publishes the only global assessment of whether and how national governments are producing and sharing air quality data with the public. Our most recent assessment found that at least one billion people are living where their national government doesn’t monitor air quality and that less than one-quarter of the world’s countries provide open access to maximally useful air quality data.
