Open data is data that can be freely used, reused, and redistributed by anyone. OpenAQ was founded around the principle that access to air quality data should be open, free, and accessible. 

Benefits of open data include:

* Transparency and public oversight - increased access to makes it easier for the public to engage in oversight and encourages greater public participation in government affairs.
* Increased collaboration - accessible data enables increased collaboration around key social challenges.
* Innovation - removing financial barriers to accessing data promotes new opportunities for innovative approaches to solving challenging issues both in the public and private sectors .
* Equity - increasing access to data fosters more equitable solutions.

The OpenAQ harmonizes the world's open air quality data sources into a single comprehensive and accessible open source data platform. We believe increased open data for air quality can empower a global community of changemakers to solve air inequality. In addition to providing the world's largest open source air quality data platform, OpenAQ advocates for increased open access to air quality data
